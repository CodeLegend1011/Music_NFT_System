## Introduction

The **Music NFT Marketplace** is a blockchain-based platform built on Ethereum where artists can mint, upload, and sell their music as Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). The project uses cutting-edge web3 technologies, including smart contracts, IPFS for decentralized storage, and MetaMask for wallet integration.

## Features

- **Artist Dashboard**: Artists can mint music NFTs, view royalties earned, and check how many NFTs they have sold.
- **Client Marketplace**: Clients can explore, search, and buy music NFTs, which are then stored in their collection.
- **Royalty Distribution**: Ensures artists receive a set royalty percentage every time their NFT is sold.
- **Search Functionality**: Clients can search for specific music NFTs using the search bar.
- **Profile Page**: Displays user account details, including balance, address, and number of NFTs owned.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React.js, CSS, HTML
- **Backend**: Solidity (Smart Contracts)
- **Blockchain**: Ethereum
- **Storage**: IPFS (for decentralized metadata and music storage)
- **Wallet Integration**: MetaMask
- **Libraries**: ethers.js, OpenZeppelin Contracts

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (latest stable version)
- MetaMask Wallet extension installed in your browser
- Ganache (for local Ethereum blockchain testing)

## Usage

1. **Artist Side**:
   - Mint and upload music NFTs.
   - View royalties earned and the number of NFTs sold.

2. **Client Side**:
   - Search and explore the NFT marketplace.
   - Buy music NFTs and view your collection in the profile section.

## Smart Contracts

The smart contracts handle the minting, transferring, and royalty distribution for music NFTs. They are built using Solidity and deployed on the Ethereum blockchain. We use OpenZeppelin libraries to ensure the contracts are secure and efficient.

**Contract Features**:
- NFT Minting
- Royalty Payments
- Ownership Transfers

### Contract Deployment
Contracts are deployed using Remix IDE or Hardhat. Ensure the addresses are updated in the frontend configuration after deployment.
